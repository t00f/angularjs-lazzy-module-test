What's that ?
=============

We are currently working on an AngularJS project that has to deal with transgenic Mouses.

To enable lazzy loading modules, we defined a sample project that gather all we found on AngularJS Framework.

Do I need something else ?
==========================
This demo is using different AngularJS libraries such as :
* requirejs : https://github.com/Nikku/requirejs-angular-define
* restangular : https://github.com/mgonto/restangular

You will need to use the Flask server test to retrieve module information :

How to use it ?
===============
Use python server to launch it ::

    $ cd app
    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...

Go to your browser at localhost:8000
